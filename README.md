# Meteor Hammer

A laughably light wrapper around [Hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/) (a JavaScript library for adding touch gestures) and associated [JQuery plugin](https://github.com/hammerjs/jquery.hammer.js), in order to make them work with Meteor.

We've had some issues with the [hammer:hammer](https://atmospherejs.com/hammer/hammer) atmosphere package due to the (currently) missing `package.js`. There are GitHub issues related to Meteor use open on the Hammer.js repo, but issues and pull requests don't seem to be being resolved at present and so we decided to create and maintain this package.
